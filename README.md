# FSK-Encode-Decode

# What it is

An encoder and decoder for a frequency-shift-key modulated wav input/output

# Why I made it

I couldn't find a suitable encoder/decoder for FSK files written in Python so I made my own

I needed to generate a datastream to be embedded in a video that wasn't susceptable to extreme audio compression so FSK was the way to go

# How to use it

Run the main script, there is standard usage at the bottom of the file
